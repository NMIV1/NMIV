          <h1>Using ChatGPT as a language learning medium:</h1>

          <p>
            As a language model, ChatGPT is trained on a vast amount of text
            data from various sources, which means it has a rich vocabulary and
            a good understanding of grammar and syntax in many languages. When
            learning a new language, it can be beneficial to practice speaking
            and listening to a native speaker. However, finding a native speaker
            to practice with can be challenging, especially if you are in an
            area where your target language is not commonly spoken. This is
            where ChatGPT can be useful. As an AI language model, ChatGPT can
            act as a language partner, providing you with a conversational
            practice partner whenever you need it.

          <h1>How this proof of concept works:</h1>

          <p>
            Using the ChatGPT API, Javascript, CSS, and HTML this website was
            put together to demonstrate how simple scenarios, like at a
            resturant or with a taxi driver, can improve ChatGPT's accessibility
            in language learning.
          </p>

            Side Note: I did not want to set up another server to hide my API
            key so please enjoy the video.
          </p>

          <p>
            While ChatGPT can be used as a language partner to practice
            conversational skills, it is not designed specifically for language
            learning purposes. One of the reasons why ChatGPT may not be an
            ideal language learning tool is that it lacks a structured
            curriculum or lesson plan. Language learners typically need a
            structured approach to acquiring new vocabulary and grammar
            concepts, as well as opportunities to practice using them in
            context.
          </p>

          <h1>Current drawbacks:</h1>

          <p>
            Currently ChatGPT is hard to control. As seen in the video
            demonstration ChatGPT does not always listen to the system messages
            it's given and may defualt to a simple assistant instead of whatever
            role was hoped for. This is because ChatGPT is designed to generate
            responses based on the patterns and trends it identifies in the data
            it has been trained on. However, it may not always understand the
            context or intent behind a user's message, leading to
            misinterpretations or errors in its response.
