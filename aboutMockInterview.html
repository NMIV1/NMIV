          <h1>Problem statement:</h1>

          <p>
            There is an increasing amount of pressure amongst those early on in their tech careers to land an internship. When it comes to prepping for technical interviews, people typically turn to apps that help hone their knowledge on data structures & algorithms while overlooking the behavioral aspect of these interviews. How might we introduce the structure and the behavioral aspects of a technical interview to students preparing for technical interviews, in an accessible and interactive way?

          <p>
            On this project my role was the testing and devlopment of the ChatGPT back end. I worked with the ChatGPT API and set up testing enviorments to determine of ChatGPT was customer ready.
          I also worked on front-end development using React Native, co-led ChatGPT integration, and contributed to backend
          processes using Flask, Python, and different APIs.
